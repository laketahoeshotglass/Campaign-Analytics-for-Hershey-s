Hershey, in an attempt to continue benefiting from the increase in demand of chocolate and snacks from at-home consumption during & post pandemic, is interested in launching a new product. The new product is slated to launch 11/1/2022 however before launching the new product, Hersey needs some analysis done. Hershey has tasked your team to run analysis on pre-launch surveys to provide insights if the product should be launched. If you believe the product should be launched (#spoiler, you should recommend launching), your team will then be tasked to monitor the media campaign. The media campaign has a flight of 12-weeks and the primary goal is to drive awareness and secondarily to drive sales of the new product. After the campaign ends, your team is to provide deeper insights into how the campaign performed and provide valuable feedback to Hersey if the product should continue and if media support is needed to continue driving awareness and sales into 2023.
YOU are part of a data analytics team at a media agency who will be activating the campaign to drive awareness and sales.
